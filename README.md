# Air Quality Analysis and Prediction


# Air Quality Analysis and Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing air quality data and predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to understand pollution trends and forecast future air quality levels.

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand pollutant patterns and correlations.
- Build machine learning models to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI).
- Compare different models and evaluate their accuracy.
- Visualize air quality trends and prediction results.
